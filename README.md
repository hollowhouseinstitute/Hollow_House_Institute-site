## Institute Mandate

Hollow House Institute is an independent governance and audit body focused on **longitudinal behavioral risk in AI systems**.

We examine how repeated AI use reshapes:
- human judgment
- escalation behavior
- accountability assignment
- organizational decision-making

Our work addresses risks that do not appear in point-in-time reviews, static benchmarks, or model evaluations.

---

## Core Focus Areas

- Behavioral drift over time  
- Decision substitution and confidence reinforcement  
- Escalation decay and override erosion  
- Normalization of workarounds  
- Accumulated identity and governance harm  

Behavior is treated as **auditable infrastructure**, not anecdotal signal.

## Governance Framework

### Longitudinal Relational Governance Framework™

A proprietary audit and governance framework that converts repeated human–AI interaction into **measurable, reviewable governance risk**.

**Foundational Doctrine**
- Time turns behavior into infrastructure  
- Behavior is the most honest data there is
